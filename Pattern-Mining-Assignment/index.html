        <td>This rule indicates that when customers buy a combination of biscuits, fruit, frozen foods, and vegetables they are very likely to also purchase bread and cake. The high confidence (0.8941) suggests a strong relationship between these items, making it useful for cross-promotional strategies.</td>

        <td>This rule shows that customers who purchase fruit and vegetables and spend a high amount of money are also very likely to buy bread and cake, with a high confidence of 0.8933. This insight could be used to place these items near each other in the store to boost sales.</td>

        <td>This rule indicates a significant likelihood (confidence of 0.8732) that customers who buy fruit and spend a high amount of money will also buy bread and cake.
